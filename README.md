Smart Routine Management System (SRMS)

A real-time, problem-based software solution designed to automate and optimize university class routine scheduling by balancing student convenience, teacher workload, and academic resource utilization.

Project Overview

Universities often rely on manual or semi-manual processes to prepare class routines. These processes result in:

* Long waiting gaps for students
* Unbalanced teacher workloads
* Inefficient classroom usage
* Repeated conflicts every semester

The Smart Routine Management System (SRMS) addresses these issues by providing an intelligent, automated, and constraint-based scheduling platform for universities.

This system is designed based on real academic problems and focuses on creating a better learning and teaching environment.

Core Objectives

* Automate university class routine generation
* Eliminate unnecessary class gaps for students
* Balance teacher workload and preferences
* Optimize classroom and time-slot utilization
* Provide conflict-free and adaptable schedules

Key Outcomes

* Reduced time wastage for students
* Balanced and fair teacher workload
* Improved teaching quality
* Better student satisfaction
* Efficient academic management

System Users

Admin

  * Manages departments, courses, classrooms, batches, and rules
Teacher

  * Submits course preferences and availability
  * Views workload and consultation schedules
Student

  * Views optimized routines
  * Downloads schedules and receives updates



Major Features

* Availability-based scheduling
* Maximum continuous class constraints
* Fixed consultation time support

Automated Routine Generation

* Considers teacher availability
* Course credits and batch constraints
* Classroom capacity and availability
* Student convenience and gap minimization

Conflict Detection & Resolution

* Detects teacher conflicts
* Detects room clashes
* Resolves overlapping classes automatically

Routine Management

* Online routine viewing
* PDF and Excel download support
* Routine regeneration when data changes

Student-Centric Constraints

* Minimum and maximum classes per day
* No unnecessary class gaps
* Better off-day distribution

Multilanguage Support

* English and Bangla language support
* Easy language switching

Non-Functional Requirements

* High performance for multi-department scheduling
* Secure data handling
* User-friendly interface
* Modular and maintainable system design
* Scalable for future expansion

 FACTOR Analysis

*Functionality
  Automates routine creation and management

*Application Domain
  University academic management systems

*Condition
  Requires accurate input data for effective scheduling

*Technology
  Web-based system using modern frontend and backend tools

*Objective
  Conflict-free, optimized academic routines

*Responsibility
  Acts as an intelligent scheduling decision system



SDLC Model

The project follows the **Incremental SDLC Model** because:

* The system is modular and medium-scale
* Requirements may evolve over time
* Early delivery and feedback are beneficial
* Risk is lower compared to full upfront development

Each module is designed, developed, tested, and delivered incrementally.
